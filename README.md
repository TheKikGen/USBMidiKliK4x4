# USBMidiKliK4x4
A multi-port USB MIDI interface for the STM32DUINO platform.

Download the last firmware here : https://github.com/TheKikGen/USBMidiKliK4x4/releases

Check also the wiki here : https://github.com/TheKikGen/USBMidiKliK4x4/wiki

The story of this project starts with a hack of the MIDIPLUS/MIDITECH 4x4 USB to MIDI interface.
Needing more midi jacks, I bought a second Miditech interface, but I discovered it was not possible to use 2 Miditech / Midiplus MIDI USB 4X4 on the same computer to get 8x8, and according to the Miditech support, as that usb midi interface was not updateable at all !
I was stucked....That was motivating me enough to write a totally new and better firmware : the UsbMidiKlik4x4 project was born.

The current version V2.5 supports full USB midi until 16xIN , 16XOUT plus routing features, enabling configurables standalone mode, merge mode, thru mode, split mode, midi transformation, midi clock, etc., huge sysex flow, configuration menu from serial USB, and is very fast and stable thanks to the STM32F103.  More of that, you can aggregate until 5 3x3 boards seen as one by activating the "Bus mode".

## USBMidiKliK4x4 features
+ STM32F103C8 / STM32F103CB / STM32F103RB / STM32F103RC uC support
+ Bluepill and Miditech 4x4 board support
+ 16 MIDI USB IN/OUT
+ 15-16  MIDI JACK IN  / JACKS OUT *1
+ 8 Virtual internal IN/OUT
+ 4 midi clock and Midi Time Code generators
+ Full  remote configuration by SYSEX
+ Configuration user interface from a serial USB terminal
+ Support of large sysex flow
+ Complex routing engine allowing to route any IN to any OUT
+ Transformation pipes allowing dynamic modification of midi messages
+ Customisable USB device ProductStringName, Vendor and Product Ids
+ STANDALONE mode (no USB host needed)
+ INTELLITHRU mode allowing specific routing rules when USB is idle
+ Stackable interfaces in bus mode to get 6x6 to 15x15 physical midi ports

The "pipeline" feature allows you to modify an incoming midi message through a chain of transformation functions (a "pipe"), e.g.,  transpose notes, split, map channel to another, map CC to another, etc...New pipes can be easily added in order to obtain complex midi transformations without degrading performances.

8 Midi clock generator / virtual ports are available within the routing engine. Below is an overview of the possible paths for a midi message packet, coming from a physical in port to a physical out port :
<img  width="650" border="0" src="https://github.com/TheKikGen/USBMidiKliK4x4/wiki/pipelines/umk4x4-routing-engine-overview.jpg"  />

The bus mode allows the aggregation of up to five interfaces using the I2C protocol, which will be seen as a single interface by the usb host and/or the midi routing engine (including standalone mode).

Last release of the firmware can be found here : https://github.com/TheKikGen/USBMidiKliK4x4/releases/
Update tool is included. Unzip and launch the UMK_BluePillUpdate.bat file (Windows only currently).   


## Bluepill and USBMidiKlik

<img width="250" border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wo1H27RQYiU/XDzO9VG3vdI/AAAAAAAAAWA/KehLjyXhLTg_nmjjmEkO7LZtY5H83Rr-ACLcBGAs/s1600/20190113_221557.jpg"  />

I have realized a Bluepill "MIDI shield", to easily transform that cheap uC board to a powerfull 3 IN / 3 OUT USB MIDI interface, based on the exactly same firmware as USB MidiKlik 4x4.  The board is USB Powered, so no additional power supply necessary. It works driverless as a class compliant device, with Windows XP SP3, Vista 32 and 64 Bit, Windows 7 / 8 / 10   32 and 64 Bit, and Mac OS X, Linux ALSA, Akai MPC Live/X/Force, IOS, Android.

Some (few) units are currently available at Tindie :

Specific PCB without DIN 5 female to allow a deported DIN 5 rail are also available. Contact me for more details.

# USBMidiKliK4x4 - Configuration overview

Prebuilt binaries are compiled for the tkg-hid-bootloader since the 2.5 version, so you need the tkg-hid-bootloader firmware here :
https://github.com/TheKikGen/stm32-tkg-hid-bootloader/blob/master/F1/bootloader_only_binaries/tkg_hid_generic_pc13.bin

You can then use TKG-FLASH.EXE provided in the release to flash the 128K or the 64k bluepill version.  
The 128K firmware should work on a 64K Bluepill most of the time. If it is not the case, try the 64K firmware version.  

2 modes can be used to configure the USBMidiKlik midi : system exclusive messages or a configuration menu. 
Sysex messages have the following format, and ARE ONLY INTERPRETED ON CABLE 0 OR MIDI IN JACK 1 :

	F0 77 77 78 <sysex function id > <data> F7

The "F0 77 77 78" is the specific sysex header for USBMidiKlik4x4. Know that it is a totally unofficial header.
You will find the sysex V2.5 documentation in the repository :

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheKikGen/USBMidiKliK4x4/master/UMK-4X4-SYSEX-IPL.TXT

The second way is to activate the configuration menu on the serial port with the following sysex :

       F0 77 77 78 08 F7

To send that Sysex, you can use for example, MIDIOX, or the "sendmidi" command line utility by gbevin :

       sendmidi dev "USB MIDIKliK 4x4" syx hex 77 77 78 08

You will find the last binary release of sendmidi here :  https://github.com/gbevin/SendMIDI/releases
       
Immediatly after sending this sequence with your prefered midi software, the interface will reboot in CDC serial COM mode, allowing you to open a terminal to configure easily USBMIDIKLIK. 

You can use any software like TERATERM, on Windows, or "screen" on MacOs.  The bauds rate must be set to 115200.
The following menu should appear after connecting to the right serial USB port , and pressing ENTER :

	USBMIDIKLIK 4x4 - BLUEPILL STMF103C8x - V2.0

Don't forget to save your settings with the "s" option before leaving the configuration menu with "x".
